# TMDMobileNG
Language Support: Simplified Chinese, English
## Introduction
TMDMobileNG is the client side of C/S system. It's both a sensor collector and a AI transportation mode detector. The model is updating on the server side. And this application is mostly for research use. It will be great if you provide your suggestions about our Application or the detection way itself.
## Architecture
This Application is the next generation version of TMDMobile. We are trying to use Android Architecture Components with Kotlin to help improve the performance during runtime and both user experience and developer experience. The application didn't architect so well due to the urgent deadline. Any suggestions or bugs will help us a lot.
